        "The user either inputs their city or allows the app to use their current location via geolocation.\n",
        "2. Fetch Current Weather Data\n",
        "Call the weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to get the current weather condition for the user’s location.\n",
        "The API will return information like temperature, weather condition (sunny, rainy, snow), wind speed, and humidity.\n",
        "3. Weather-to-Meal Mapping Logic\n",
        "Based on the weather data, define a set of meal types.\n",
        "Example mapping:\n",
        "Hot weather (Above 25°C): Light meals, salads, cold drinks.\n",
        "Cold weather (Below 15°C): Comfort foods like soups, stews, hot drinks.\n",
        "Rainy weather: Warm, cozy dishes like casseroles or baked goods.\n",
        "Sunny weather: Grilled dishes, smoothies, or fruit-based recipes.\n",
        "4. Recipe Recommendation\n",
        "Use the weather data to send a query to the Spoonacular API for recipes.\n",
        "For example, on a cold day, request soups, casseroles, or hearty meals. On a hot day, request refreshing salads or light meals.\n",
        "5. Display Recipe Results\n",
        "Display a list of recipe suggestions that match the current weather conditions, including images, ingredients, cooking instructions, and prep time."
