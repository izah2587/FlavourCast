# FlavourCast
FlavourCast is a tool that uses WeatherStack and Spoonacular APIs to give users food recommendations based on the weather in their city.
WeatherStack API returns weather details like temperature and weather description which we then map to different food types. 
We pass these mappings to the spoonacular API to get food recommendations.
